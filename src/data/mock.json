Despite a Supreme Court order to fix the mess, the Trump administration has been dragging its feet—though officials were quick to assure everyone he's 'alive and secure' in a facility with a name that screams Bond villain hideout.\n\nPresident Trump, who initially resisted helping, now says he respects the Supreme Court and will bring him back—right after a cozy sit-down with El Salvador’s president. Meanwhile, the administration thanked Bukele for taking in the 'most violent alien enemies of the World,' adding a casual nod to human rights with the phrase: 'Their future is up to President B.' Cool, cool, totally normal diplomatic vibes.",

Trump clarified on Truth Social that “NO ONE is getting off the hook,” because in this White House, logic gets the same treatment as taxes: aggressively avoided.\n\nWhile the stock market plays peek-a-boo with Apple shares, Trump’s cabinet stays busy. Navarro hugs it out with Elon Musk after being called a moron, Pennsylvania deals with a governor’s mansion fire (possibly caused by inflation), and gang members are being deported under an 18th-century law that sounds made-up but isn’t. Meanwhile, Trump’s doctor insists he’s \"fully fit\"—which definitely includes the ability to post conspiracy theories and dodge cholesterol.\n\nOn top of that, the healthcare program for 9/11 responders is doing the hokey pokey—cut, restored, and cut again—while Naomi Klein warns that Trumpism is evolving into \"bunker-based leadership.\" And just when you thought it couldn’t get wilder, *SNL* compares Trump to Jesus, which, frankly, feels like the most reasonable part of the week.",

The new math means if you’re a Chinese mega-ship with 15,000 containers, congrats, that’ll be $1.8 million — unless you order a ship made in the U.S., in which case, fee waived and a gold star sticker. The fees begin in 180 days, just enough time for every shipping executive to Google “How to build a boat.”\n\nWhile this may slightly annoy global supply chains and potentially launch banana prices into orbit, officials say this bold move sends a 'demand signal' for U.S.-built ships — also known as 'a very expensive suggestion.'

        "longBody": "In an international culinary twist, Japan is offering to import more rice and soybeans in trade talks with the U.S., hoping it’ll be enough to convince President Trump to stop treating Japanese exports like piñatas. Trump, wielding tariffs like a samurai with a calculator set to chaos mode, claims Japan charges a 700% rice tax—though Japan insists he’s using rice prices from a feudal-era farmer’s almanac.\n\nWith tariffs paused for now (probably because someone accidentally hit 'snooze'), Japan’s negotiators are treading carefully. The U.S. wants more Japanese purchases of American meat, fish, potatoes, and perhaps freedom fries, while Japan asks for a numbered list of priorities—because even trade wars need bullet points. As talks resume in Washington, one thing is certain: rice is now a geopolitical pawn, and California's exports might depend on whether Trump remembers which coast it's on.",

Some experts say gold could reach $3,880 by year’s end—assuming it doesn’t have to bail out margin-called investors first. And amidst all this, savvy investors are turning to cash—not because they're scared, but because holding onto dollar bills apparently gives them superpowers like 'discipline' and 'resilience.'\n\nSo whether you're stockpiling bullion, nervously clutching your cash, or just staring at your 401(k) while whispering, 'do something,' one thing’s clear: Wall Street has entered its FOMO-fueled, tariff-triggered midlife crisis.

        "body": "Welcome back to the germ-nasium! Quick tips: people *do* judge your form, re-rack your weights unless you want enemies, ask nicely to share, and maybe skip the joint-punishing burpees. Also, put the squat hooks lower, you tiptoeing maniacs!",
        "longBody": "Rejoice, for the hallowed halls of iron and sweat have reopened, and we've bravely ditched the sanitizer! As a seasoned survivor, let me debunk myth #1: people *are* judging your every wobble, but mostly in silence (unless you're female, then expect helpful 'mansplainers' - deploy headphones). We've forgotten basic sharing, so here's a refresher: politely ask the dude admiring his traps if you can \"work in\" while he rests. Crucially, for the love of all that's holy, PUT THE SQUAT RACK HOOKS LOWER. Stop playing tiptoe-roulette with heavy barbells.\n\nAlso, re-rack your weights! Your gym isn't your mom's basement. And please, step *away* from the dumbbell rack to do your curls; others need access to the tiny weights you're guarding with your life. Need help? Ask someone who looks like they shower regularly. Need a spotter? Ask nicely, state your intentions, learn the secret code (\"My bar!\" \"Take it!\"). Ditch the useless pull-up bands; focus on slow lowering (eccentrics!). And maybe reconsider those burpees – they're joint-jarring misery named after their inventor; the Ski-Erg won't betray you like that. Despite the silent judgment and potential hazards, remember, we're mostly happy you're here... just please wipe down the bench.",

        "body": "Nigel Farage is totally cool with America’s spa-day chickens joining British menus, arguing that if Brits are already eating chlorinated lettuce and Thai mystery meat, what’s one more chemically blessed entrée? Meanwhile, his Reform UK party might actually gobble up more seats than Labour or the Tories, proving the real winner of this election season might just be the poultry lobby.",
        "longBody": "In a bold culinary and political statement, Nigel Farage has defended welcoming chlorinated chicken from the US into the UK, suggesting that once you've doused your lettuce in chlorine and your morals in compromise, the leap to American-style poultry is but a logical marinade. Critics fear a race to the bottom for animal welfare standards, but Farage insists British farmers can thrive by selling luxury chickens to people who name their hens and shop at farmers’ markets. \n\nMeanwhile, in a plot twist no one saw coming (except pollsters), Farage’s Reform UK party is flapping its way to a possible lead in parliamentary seats, despite lagging in overall vote share. A recent mega poll suggests that with just over 23% of the vote, Reform could win 180 seats—leaving both Labour and the Tories scrambling for relevance and perhaps reconsidering their anti-chlorine stance. With local elections looming and Farage fending off Elon Musk’s unsolicited political advice like a man dodging pigeon droppings in Trafalgar Square, one thing is clear: British politics has officially gone to the birds.",

        "body": "England’s children’s commissioner has advised parents to stop being their kids’ BFFs and start being the phone-snatching villains they were born to be. If your 10-year-old spends more time online than you spend pretending not to be on TikTok, it might be time for a family tech detox — or at least an awkward chat about screen time and dopamine.",
        "longBody": "Dame Rachel de Souza has declared that it's time for parents to put down their own phones, resist the urge to appease tiny tyrants, and embrace their inner tech tyrant instead. Writing in the Sunday Times, she said parents need to stop being their kids’ Netflix-enabling roommates and start acting like, well, parents — the kind that say no to iPhones, screen zombies, and online doomscrolling. While 23% of kids now spend over four hours a day glued to a screen (basically an unpaid internship in becoming a social media influencer), de Souza says it’s high time parents set boundaries, even if it results in door-slamming and cries of 'you’ve ruined my life!'\n\nShe warns that banning phones in schools is only part of the solution — most of the digital chaos happens after school, when kids enter the Wi-Fi wild west of parental oversight. But here’s the twist: adults themselves are just as addicted, doomscrolling into oblivion while wondering why their child keeps texting the family dog. So, if you want your kid to touch grass and not just like photos of it, maybe start by leading the way. Sorry, the group chat can wait.",

        "body": "America logged over a million abortions again in 2024, but with a twist—abortion access now comes with a hefty travel budget and a roadmap of friendlier states. Meanwhile, the CDC’s abortion stats team was yeeted into obscurity, proving once again that counting things is only patriotic if it’s not politically awkward.",
        "longBody": "In 2024, America’s most popular cross-state road trip wasn’t to see the Grand Canyon—it was to get an abortion. Over 155,000 people packed their bags and left their home states to find reproductive healthcare in friendlier places, like Illinois and New Mexico, which are now unofficially sponsored by GPS apps and pro-choice bumper stickers. Meanwhile, the Trump administration celebrated its love of transparency by quietly defunding the CDC's abortion data unit, leaving researchers wondering if science has been replaced by vibes and political whims.\n\nWhile the Guttmacher Institute and #WeCount scramble to keep tabs on abortion trends, the CDC’s once-nerdy data crew was shown the door, perhaps for the crime of… measuring things? The administration also seems to be dancing a jittery two-step around its own Project 2025 wishlist, which includes creepy ideas like counting miscarriages and chemotherapy side effects as ‘child deaths’—because, obviously, that’s a totally normal and not-at-all-dystopian way to do public health. Experts now fear not only for data accuracy but for the privacy of anyone seeking or providing care, as the nation continues its bizarre evolution into a patchwork of medical havens and health deserts, all while the official scorekeepers are told to pack up their clipboards.",

The government’s proposed trade-off? Help some poor kids while giving disabled folks the cold economic shoulder.",
        "longBody": "In an inspiring demonstration of 'progressive' budgeting, Labour is proposing to balance compassion with cuts by helping some poor children while simultaneously tightening disability benefits. One MP summed it up as, ‘Help the toddlers, forget the disabled, what could go wrong?’ The new legislation includes such heartwarming proposals as revoking benefits from people who can’t wash below the waist—because clearly, soap access is the new welfare metric.\n\nUnsurprisingly, a rebellion is brewing within Labour ranks, with MPs asking why they’re voting before the Office for Budget Responsibility has even finished its homework. Critics argue that moral math shouldn’t be based on trade-offs that pit vulnerable groups against each other, while backbenchers stare at their slim majorities like contestants in a political Hunger Games. With zero guarantees the cuts will actually help people work again, this is less policy and more wishful austerity cosplay.",
